The Classic - Joan as Policewoman

D      G            B          C                 D
  I am home in your arms and I feel like this is living
            G    B        C           D
Itâ€™s been a lo---ng rocky road I have run

         Em               C    Am    D
Could it be - that you're all, all I need to get by
      G           B           C               D
And I love how it feels to be so high without sinnin'

             G   B       C              D
It's been an a---lmighty drop into your heart
       Em           C        Am            D                G
And it feels like I made it, made out with all I was hoping for

G        Em      Am               D
Could it be that you, you are the one? (x2)

       G                B              C             D
And we blow through the air like we're floating on a feather
         G    B         C            D
Rock and ro---ll is for sure here to stay

         Em              C       Am              D
And this song we've been singing feels like it's always been sung
       G                B            C                 D
Do you know what that's called? Archetypal, you're the classic

         G             B           C           D
Yes, you hummed me the tune that enraptured my heart
        Em               C         Am            D          G
And you threw out all my devils to make room for monumental love

G        Em      Am               D
Could it be that you, you are the one? (x2)


C/G                 G           Bb           B       C

C/G                 G            Bb         B            C

C/G                 G                 Bb       B           C
No I never felt the earth fluster the butterflies like you do
C                  D(X\)
No I never felt anything like you

     G            B          C                 D
I am home in your arms and i feel like this is living
            G    B        C           D
It's been a lo---ng rocky road I have run
       Em           Am      C             D                G
And it feels like I made it made out with all I was hoping for

G        Em      Am               D
Could it be that you, you are the one? (x3)

G                   Em                  Am                  D
See ya lay yes as I see ya lay yes as I see ya lay yes as I see you lay yes as I (x2)
